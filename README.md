# LumGun

## Overview

LumGun is an online shooting game where players can sign in and compete against each other in a 2D map. Players move using the W, A, S, or D keys, aim with their mouse, and shoot bullets at each other. The game is developed entirely in Python and Pygame. This project is my final project for cyber in the Israeli education system.
